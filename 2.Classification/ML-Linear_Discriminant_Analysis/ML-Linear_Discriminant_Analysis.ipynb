    "The matrix\n",

    "**Type I Error**： Of the 333 individuals who defaulted, 252 (or 75.7%) were missed by LDA. So while the overall error\n",

    "From the perspective of a credit card company that is trying to identify\n",
    "high-risk individuals, an error rate of 252/333 = 75.7% among individuals\n",
    "who default may well be unacceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type II Error**：Only 23 out\n",

    "### Why does LDA do such a poor job of classifying the customers who default?\n",
    "\n",
    ">In other words, why does it have such a low sensitivity? \n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is trying to approximate the Bayes classifier, which has the lowest\n",

    "That is, the Bayes classifier will yield the smallest possible total number\n",
    "of misclassified observations, irrespective of which class the errors come\n",
    "from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayes classifier works by assigning an observation to the class for\n",
    "which the posterior probability pk(X) is greatest. In the two-class case, this\n",
    "amounts to assigning an observation to the default class if $Pr(default = Yes|X = x) > 0.5.$\n",

    "The answer lies in the **bias-variance trade-off**:\n",
